This is a small Eeact Native sample project,intended to show frontend work. You can press the play button to play the song and then pause it as well. 

NOTE: This project is attempting to mimic the search screen of the app Spotify, I take zero credit for the design and created this project to see how I could recreate it to show my skills using React Native.

The song used is Honey Jam by massobeats:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGMQbVfYVmI
